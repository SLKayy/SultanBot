# Introduction
[SultanBot](https://github.com/ansarirayyan/SultanBot/) is a Discord guild/server bot made using the [`discord.py`](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library. The aim of this project is to port all the awesome and non-redundant features of [awaaz](https://github.com/ansarirayyan/awaaz/) into what Discord might consider as a proper bot.

# Usage

* `sultanim spam` will spam the chat a bit
* `sultanim anti-fbi` will attempt to free the user who executes it of any legal trouble
* automatic profanity manager which censors cuss words from messages and posts a warning

# To-Do List
* switch over to `profanity-filter` from `profanity` once `spacy` is fixed
