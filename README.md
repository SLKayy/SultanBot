# Introduction
[SultanBot](https://github.com/ansarirayyan/SultanBot/) is a Discord guild/server bot made using the [`discord.py`](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library. The aim of this project is to port all the awesome and non-redundant features of [awaaz](https://github.com/ansarirayyan/awaaz/) into what Discord might consider as a proper bot.

# Usage

* `sultanim spam` will spam the chat a bit
* `sultanim anti-fbi` will give an attempt to free itself from any legal trouble on its own behalf
* profanity checker enabled by default (as of now, no way to turn it off w/o mingling with the code, which you are free to do)
